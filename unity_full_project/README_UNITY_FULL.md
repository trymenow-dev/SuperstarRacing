Unity Full Project Placeholder
=============================
This folder provides small assets and instructions to build a simple Unity project:

- Assets/Models/cube.obj : placeholder 3D model for a car or player cube.
- Assets/Scripts : Add the `SRNetworkManager.cs` and `PlayerController.cs` from the earlier package.
- Create a new Unity 3D project (2020.3 LTS or newer), then copy the Assets folder into the project.
- Create a scene with a Mirror NetworkManager (import Mirror), set player prefab to a cube with PlayerController script.
- To connect to the game server, you'll need a WebSocket or UNET-compatible transport or write a custom transport to talk to the authoritative binary protocol (or use the Node server's socket.io endpoints as an interim).
